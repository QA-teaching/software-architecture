**MVC** stands for Model-View-Controller, and it is a software architectural pattern commonly used in the development of user interfaces and web applications. The main purpose of MVC is to separate an application into three interconnected components, each with its own responsibilities, to improve modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

Here's a brief overview of each component in the MVC pattern:

**Model:**

Represents the application's data and business logic.
Responsible for managing the data, logic, and rules of the application.
The model notifies the view and controller when there are changes in the data.

**View:**

Represents the user interface and presentation of the application.
Displays the data from the model to the user and sends user input to the controller.
The view is responsible for presenting information to the user in a human-readable format.

**Controller:**

Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
Handles user input and updates the model accordingly.
Receives input from the view, processes it, and updates the model and view accordingly.
Manages the flow of data between the model and the view.
The separation of concerns provided by MVC allows for easier maintenance, code reuse, and collaboration among developers. Changes to one component (e.g., the user interface) do not directly impact the others, promoting a more modular and scalable design.

MVC is commonly used in various programming languages and frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Django, Spring (Java), and many others, for developing web applications and graphical user interfaces.
